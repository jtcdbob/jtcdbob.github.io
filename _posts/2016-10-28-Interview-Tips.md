I have been sent interview tips from some companies and they prove quite helpful to read and think about. Here is a list for quick reference.

A Quora Post on getting better prepared for data structure/algorithm questions in an interview. [Link](https://www.quora.com/How-can-one-be-well-prepared-to-answer-data-structure-algorithm-questions-in-interviews). Some other posts discussed in this post:

* [ABC - Always Be Coding](https://medium.com/always-be-coding/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2#.dzxncni3u). Good general tips on what mentality to take on when approaching an interview. Also some great links for basic data structure and algorithm complexity.
* [Know Thy Complexities](http://bigocheatsheet.com). Good overview of complexity and some common data structure. I don't even know them all, should look more into this.
* [How to Ace an Algorithms Interview](https://www.palantir.com/2011/09/how-to-rock-an-algorithms-interview/). Page from Palantir. Great resource. They have a series of this:
    * [The Coding Interview](https://www.palantir.com/2011/10/the-coding-interview/)
    * [How to Rock a Phone Interview](https://www.palantir.com/2012/09/how-to-rock-a-phone-interview/).
    * [HOW TO ACE A SYSTEMS DESIGN INTERVIEW](https://www.palantir.com/2011/10/how-to-ace-a-systems-design-interview/)

[Top 10 Algorithms for Coding Interviews](http://www.programcreek.com/2012/11/top-10-algorithms-for-coding-interview/). Good nice resource that organize coding questions by topics. Systematic approaches to tackle coding questions are important.
