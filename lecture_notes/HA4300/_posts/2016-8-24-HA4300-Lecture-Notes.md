## Wine is cross disciplinary

### Agriculture and life science
* Entomology (study of insects). Some insects destroy vines.
* Food biochemistry. Carbon-dating wine found in boats.

### Architecture, art and planting
* Architecture
* City and regional planning

### Arts and science
* Dance. Foot tramp the grapes in the day and dance at night. Foot heat starts fermentation.
* Viking studies. Toasting comes from Viking tradition.

### Engineering
* Environmental and water resource engineering. Creating new ways of using water (more efficiently).
* Electrical engineering (RFIP chips on bottles to prevent counterfeits).

### Hotel Administrations
* Finance
* Hotel planning and design

### Human ecology
* Policy analysis and management
* Human development (how alcohol impacts human development).

### Industrial and labor relations
* Economics
* Labor relations, laws and histories.

## Class history
* Vance A. Christian
* Stephen A. Mutkoski
* Cheryl S. Stanley

US is the largest wine consumption country.

Two magazines:

* _Wine spectator_
* _Decanter_

### Wine consumption:
Total wine consumption:

* Red 43.7\%
* White 49.6\%
* Blush 6.6\%

White: Chandonnay, Pinot Grigio/Gris, Moscato, Sanvignon Blanc, Riesling

Red: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, Syrah/Shiraz

White Zinfandel

__!NOTE Perfect area for growing grapes: 30-50 N. and S.__

### Categories for coutries
New world - less than 400 years of histories. E.g. America, New Zealand, Chile, ...

Old world - more than 400 years of commericial histories. E.G. France, Germany, Spain, Moroco, ...

Grey zones - China, India (long histories but not commericially selling wine)

__!NOTE Viticulture - the growing of grapes__

__!NOTE Viniculture - the making of the wine__

## The steps in making wine

### Viticulture
1. Growing the grapes
2. Picking the grapes (harvest).
    * By hand (delicate, but labor intense)
    * By machine
3. Transporting to the winery.

Pruning the grapes.

Wind can be detrimental. If the grape skin breaks, bacteria may get in.

Variation: changing from green to color.

__!NOTE MOG: materials other than grapes__

### Viniculture:
1. Sort.
2. De-stem/crush/press.
    * Free run juice (wine): grapes crushed to extract liquid.
    * "Press wine": help bump some wine.
    * Feet crush \& bladder press
3. Add sulfur dioxide (to kill natural yeast on the grapes).
    * MUST = unfermented grape juice.
4. Vatting (into fermentation vessels). Pumping the "must" into fermentation vessels.
    * Stainless steel (only grape essential). For a lot of white wine.
    * Oak (can impact flavor).
        * Oak barrels breathe, will suck the juice in and spit it out. Wine will have wood sugar. E.g. coconut sugar, vanilla sugar, ...
        * Toasted inside. First fill, will impart flavor.
        * Second/third fill. (Neutral oak, less flavor). Wine still has slow contact with oxygen.
        * Expensive fixation. Some people dip bags of oaks into the wine (some wineries allow it).
    * Ceramics. Stainless steel and ceramics are neutral vessels.
5. Add yeast.
    * A particular strain of Saccharomyces.
    * Yeast is like spices for chef. E.g. Champagne yeast.
6. Fermentation. Yeast converts the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide.
7. Pressing.
8. Aging. Can vary from months to decades.
9. Cellar Operation. Racking.
10. Barrel operation. Sampling.
11. Aging**.
12. Blending.
13. Cellar operations.
    * Filling egg whites (for protein) or other materials.
    * Filtration (some don't allow this).
    * Stablization. Temperature (hot or cold stablization). Wine diamonds.
14. Bottling.
15. Aging**.

**Aging depends on region, laws, or winemaker preference.

Bottle sizes can also affect aging rate. Larger bottle => slower aging rate.

## Label
Label is the birth certificate of the wine.

* Who made the wine
* Where was the wine made
* When was the wine made (the year grape is harvested)
* What is in the bottle (grape variety, not always though)
