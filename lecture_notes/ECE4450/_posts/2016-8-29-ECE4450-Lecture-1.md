## Announcement

Homework from chapter 1: R22, R23, R25, P6, P8, P10, P12, P16, P18, P21, P22, P31 (due __09/07__)

## Network

### Internet

Cable: head,end -> internet

* Fiber nodes connect to head,end. Asymmetric - lots of downstream, little upstream
* Lots of coax.

ADSL - Duopoly. 26th in the world in download rates, because there is no motivation to upgrade the infrastructure

### Ethernet (wired)

`802.3` - `802` means local network, `3` means ethernet. (`802.11` for wireless, aka, wifi. `802.15` for bluetooth. `802.16` WiMAX, didn't catch on.)

Usually, ethernets sits on the same wire.

* A server, switcher, router, ISP -> internet

### Packet switching

IP, independently routed. Header (overhead) + Information packet

Benefits:

* More efficiently use of resources than circuit switching.
* Load balancing
* Statistical multiplexing
    * Buffers randomness, efficient use of downstream

What does a packet switch look like.

OC-3, OC-10, T3 ->

Input cards ->
* Buffers
* Processing
* Segmentation

Backplane ->

Output cards ->

* Buffers
* Processing
* Reassembly

T3, OC-3, OC-10

### Circuit swiching

(Slowly going away)

* Dedicates resources from start to finish
    * Wires
    * time slots (periodic)
    * fixed routes
    * NOT as efficient for _anything_
* Flexible quality of service
    * IP provides "best effort" packet service. Now is fast enough for everything.

### Topology of the internet

* Interconnection of ISPs
* Backbone - Tier 1 ISPs
    * ~12 completely interconnected ISPs.
    * Global
    * Each connected to secure Tier 2 ISPs.
    * Verizon, Sprint, MC, AT&T, ...
* Tier 2 ISPs
    * Regional
    * Not global
* Tier 3 ISPs
    * Retail customers

### Net Ne..

Communication act of 1934

* Established FCC
* Title II - common carrier requirements for Telecom
    * No discrimination - as long as you have legal status
* 1990's - dial-up services. Telephone service providers cannot discriminate agents of other ISPs.

Telecomm act of 1996

* Telecom - title II applies
* Information service - title II does not apply. FCC(2002) (broadband) ISPs are info service, not telecomm

## Layerings

### Motivations

* Division of labor
* Clear standardy
* Diversity of manufacture
* Provider services (Layer X+1), protocol (Layer X), Request service (Layer X-1). Ideally only one layer up/down.

### Open system interconnect

1. Application
2. Presentation
3. Session
4. Transport
5. NetworksData link (MAC)
6. Physical

Internet stack

* TCP/IP
    * Application
    * Transport
    * Network
* WAN/LAN
    * Data Link (MAC)
    * Physical

### End-to-end design

Internet Architecture and Innovation - Van Schewick

HostA(802.11) -> Switch(802.3) -> Router -> ... -> HostB

All brains are on the end points. Fabric is "dumb". Cooncentrating completely on end points. Foster innovation.

### Encapsulation

* HTTP/payload - HTTP packet
* Header, Payload - TCP segment
* Payload - IP datagram

## Security

### Malware

Malicious software

* Often self-replicating

Virus - requires user action

Worms - do not requires user action

Trojan horses - hidden part of otherwise usable softwares

Attacks servers, infrastructure, your laptops

Ransomware
