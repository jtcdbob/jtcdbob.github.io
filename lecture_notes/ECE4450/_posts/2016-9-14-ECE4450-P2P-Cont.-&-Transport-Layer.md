#### Content Distribution Networks (Akamai)

Main server -> distributed regional servers -> Edge server

#### Skype

Ebay purchased skype for $2.6 billion. P2P

* Communication
* Finding people
* NAT traversal

* Protocols are proprietary
* Signalling is encrypted
* Super peers maintain a distributed index of peer names and IP addresses/port numbers
* Network Address Translation (NAT)
    * Prevents a host from outside the home network for initiating a session with a host inside the network (Network layer)

##### Example with Alice and Bob

1. Alice -> Super Peer A
2. Bob -> Super peer B
3. Super peer A -- Super peer B
4. Alice -- Super peer C -- Bob

Law enforcement in Super peer C

### Transport Layer

* Supports app layer processes
* Extends network layer services to provide end-to-end communications
* Reliability

* Process - (Transport) - Process
* Host - Network (IP), unreliable - Host

* UDP - User datagram protocol - Unreliable connections
* TCP - Transmission control protocol - reliable, connections oriented

#### Port

* Identify process
* Can be open or closed
* Hacking 101 - seen for open ports - which ports respond?
* Slammer work (Jan 25, 2003)
    * 75,000 victims in 10 minutes
    * 1 IP packet over UDP
    * Scans, then sends packets to random IP addresses
    * Microsoft SQL server (unpatched)
    * MS has already distributed a patch

##### Routing

TCP sockets -> route to a process

* Source IP address
* Source port number
* Destination IP address
* Destination port number

UDP socket

* Destination IP address
* Destination port number

Benefits of UDP

* Application has greater control over transmission timing
* No connection establishment
    * No "handshake", limited overhead

Reliable Data Transfer

Application A - Transport layer - Application B

The layer has to be reliable.

##### Building blocks of reliable data transport

Error detection

* Checksum
    * IP: 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of all 16-bit word in the header
    * Cyclic redundancy check (CRC). CRC-8 connection polynomial = x^8 + x^2 + x + 1

##### ARQ Protocols
SW-ARQ (Stop and wait) - Do not transmit new packet until the last packet is acknowledged
