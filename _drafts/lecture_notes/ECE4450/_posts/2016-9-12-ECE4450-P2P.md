## Typical system

1 large file, N interested users

#### Compared to Client-Server model

* Server does all of the uploading
* One copy for each client => N distinct upload operations
    * NF bytes upload
    * Distribution time $$\frac{NF}{U}$$.
* Each client must download F bytes
    * $$d_{min} = \min \{d_1, d_2, ..., d_N\}$$.
        * Max download time $$\frac{F}{d_{m,n}}$$
        * $$D_{CS} \ge \max {...} $$.
* Linear in $$N$$

#### P2p Approach

* At the beginning, only the server has the file, but the server needs to upload only once
        * Distribution time $$\ge \frac{F}{U_B}$$
        * Peers with the slowest download speed $$d_{min}$$ will take longest to acquire the entire file
        * Distribution time $$\ge \frac{F}{d_{min}}$$
* Total upload capacity $$U_{total} = U_s + U_1 + \dots + U_N$$
    * Distribution time $$\ge\frac{U_F}{U_{total}}$$
* $$D_{P2P} \ge \max \{\frac{F}{U_s}, \frac{F}{d_{min}}, \frac{U_F}{U_s + \sum_{k = 1}{N}U_k}\}$$.
    * (Kumar) lower bound is achieved if each peer can upload a bit as soon as it is received (no delay)
    * Not linear in $$N$$. Sublinear -> much greater distribution efficiency.

#### Bit Torrent
See papers

* Chunk = distribution granularity ~ 256k
* Torrent = distribution of 1 file

Peer joins a torrent

1. Initially, the user has no chunks
2. Acquire a few chunks
3. Begin uploading to others

Details are critical.

How to prevent freeriders?

* Tit-For-Tat (game theory) - you get in return for giving
    1. User A joins a torrent
    2. Torrent tracker provides a list ~50 IP addresses for other users in the torrent
    3. User A establish TCP connections
    4. User A requests a list of available chunks from each user
        * L neighbors => L list
    5. User A sends out requests for chunks she doesn't have
        * Request chunks that are rarest among the neighbors
    6. As chunks acquired, user A will receive request for her chunks
        * Respond to 4 peers that are providing chunks at the highest rate (unchoked)
        * Pick a 5th peer at random and send chunks (optimistically unchoked)
    7. All ...

Millions of torrents

Larry Lessig - "code is law". Code/rules => behavior

Trackers are independent

* thepiratebay.org
* demonoid.com
* openbittorrent
* publicbittorrent

#### HTTP Streaming

HTTP details.

##### Request:

* Request line
* Header lines
* Entity body

Methods

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE
* CONNECT
* TRACE
* PATCH

"safe" methods - do not alter the state of the server

##### Response:

* Status
* Header lines
* Entity body

#### Streaming

HTTP - DASH

Top 10 Peak Period applications (north American)

Upstream:

* BitTorrent (26.8%)
* SSL - other (7.1%)
* HTTP (6.7%)
* Netflix (6.0%)

Downstream:

* Netflix (36.48%)
* YouTube (15.56%)
* HTTP (6.02%)
* iTunes (3.36%)

Application:

* netflix (33.81%)
* YouTube (14.61%)
* HTTP (6.08%)
* BitTorrent (4.8%)

#### HTTP Live Streaming

HTTP to request/send chunks of video/audio

Server: Audo/Video Inputs -> Media(Encoder) -> Stream Segmenter

->

(Distribution) Origin Webserver: Index File -> Index System -> HTTP

->

Client: Control, Buffer
